## **Introduction**  
  

As part of DNIF's ongoing commitment to continuous improvement and providing our customers with the best possible experience, we wish to inform you of important updates regarding the End of Life (EOL) and End of Support (EOS) timelines for various versions of the DNIF. These changes are part of our strategy to focus on the latest versions, ensuring enhanced features, better performance, and stronger security for all users.

## **Key Definitions:**  
  

- **End of Life (EOL):** The version will no longer receive updates, bug fixes, or new features.

- **End of Support (EOS):** The version will no longer receive any form of support, including critical security patches.

To ensure you continue to receive timely updates and full support, we encourage upgrading to the latest available versions. Below are the key dates for the various versions of the DNIF.

## **Version Release and Support Dates**

  
The following table outlines the key dates for different versions of the DNIF:

## **Upgrade Recommendations**  
  

- **Timely Upgrades:** As certain versions reach their EOL and EOS dates, we strongly encourage all customers to upgrade to a supported version before the dates listed above. Upgrading will ensure continued access to the latest security updates, features, and performance improvements.

- **Support Assistance:** If you need help planning your upgrade path or require assistance with the upgrade process, please reach out to our support team. We are happy to assist in ensuring a seamless transition to a newer version of the DNIF.

## **Support Availability After EOS and EOL**  
  

Once a version reaches its **EOL** and **EOS**, DNIF will no longer provide updates, bug fixes, or support for that version, including critical security patches. Therefore, to ensure the security and reliability of your environment, it is crucial to migrate to a supported version before the **EOS** date.

## **Conclusion**  
  

We are committed to ensuring that you have access to the best features, security, and performance that DNIF has to offer. By keeping your system up-to-date, you help ensure the continued success and security of your operations. If you have any questions or need assistance with upgrades, please do not hesitate to contact our support team.
