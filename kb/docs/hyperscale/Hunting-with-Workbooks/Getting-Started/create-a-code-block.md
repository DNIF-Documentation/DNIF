Code Block also known as a Python Block is used to manipulate the data and generate a new output using python.

- The Python block is a dependent block, so you mandatorily need an input data source from the DQL / Search block.
- The output data from the DQL / Search block will be used as an input to the Python block to manipulate and generate an output.
- It is a restrictive shell, no imports or invocations are allowed. Only standard pythonic functions and operations are allowed.

### **How to add a Code Block?**

- Hover on the **Workbooks** icon on the left navigation bar, it will display the folder wise view of existing workbooks in the tenant (previously known as cluster).

- Click the **plus** icon on the Workbook page and select **Code Block** from the list, the following screen will be displayed.

The python block should be added in the following format:

```
def transform(inward_array):
   for log in inward_array:
       for k,v in list(log.items()):
           if v == None:
               del log[k]
   return inward_array
```

| **Code** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| def | It is used to define a function and is a mandatory part of the block. For more information refer [https://docs.python.org/release/3.0/](https://docs.python.org/release/3.0/) |
| Inward Array | Enter the input value from the previous block (DQL) here |
| List | The list that needs to be manipulated as per your requirement. In the above example, all the v= none columns will be deleted from the list. |
| Return inward array | This is also a mandatory field, this would be the result of the manipulations done. It is also mandatory that the return format and the inward format should match. |

- Enter the query and click **Run** to execute the query, the result dataset will be displayed.

- Click **Information** icon, to view log details. You can view the log details in JSON and TABLE format.

### **Usage of json\_parse and json\_stringify  
  
**

json\_parse is used for parsing data that is received as JSON; it deserializes a JSON string into a JavaScript object. json\_stringify on the other hand is used to create a JSON string out of an object or array; it serializes a JavaScript object into a JSON string.

In the below example, a webhook plugin is run, it returns $WebhookResponse in stringified json format.

Python code block is used to parse the above mentioned response into a json object and extract the required fields to create a new json object, and json\_stringify is used to store it in $NewPayload field

### **Usage of regexp\_extract**

Extracts the first string in str that matches the regexp expression and corresponds to the regex group index.

### **Syntax  
  
**

```
regexp_extract(pattern str, string str, group int=0)
```

### **Arguments  
  
**

**pattern:** A STRING expression to be matched.  
**string:** A STRING expression with a matching pattern.  
**group:** An optional integral number expression greater or equal 0 with default 0.

### **Returns**

The REGEXP\_Extract function returns a string value.

The regexp string must be a python regular expression. String literals are unescaped. For example, to match 'abc', a regular expression for regexp can be '^abc$'. regexp may contain multiple groups. group indicates which regex group to extract. An int of 0 means matching the entire regular expression.

### **Example  
  
**

```
def transform(inward_array):
	for log in inward_array:
		log["$PacketAction"] = regexp_extract("PACKET_(w+)", log["$Action"], 1)
	return inward_array
```

In the above example, the function **regexp\_extract("PACKET\_(w+)** will return all the matching values of **PACKET\_** from the group viz. **PACKET\_ALLOWED**, **PACKET\_BLOCKED** and the new extracted value is displayed in the **$PacketAction** column as shown below:

### **Usage of regexp\_match**

Returns true if the target value exactly matches the regular expression pattern.

### **Syntax  
  
**

```
regexp_match(pattern str, string str)
```

### **Arguments**

**pattern:** A STRING expression to be matched.  
**string:** A STRING expression with a matching pattern.

### **Returns**

The REGEXP\_MATCH function returns boolean values.

REGEXP\_MATCH attempts to match the entire string contained in pattern str. For example, if pattern str is "ABC123":

REGEXP\_MATCH(pattern str, 'A') returns false.  
REGEXP\_MATCH(pattern str, 'A.\*') returns true.

### **Example  
  
**

```
def transform(inward_array):
	for log in inward_array:
		log["$PacketAction"] = str(regexp_match("PACKET_(w+)", log["$Action"]))
	return inward_array
```

In the above example, the function **str(regexp\_match("PACKET\_(w+)** will return all the matching values of **PACKET\_** viz. **PACKET\_ALLOWED**, **PACKET\_BLOCKED** and will also return a boolean value corresponding to the string if a substring of the specified string matches the regular expression pattern as shown below:
