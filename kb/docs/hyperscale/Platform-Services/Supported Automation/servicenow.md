In the above figure, a workbook named **Suspicious Remote Desktop Network Activity** is executed which contains the following blocks:

- **SQL Block:** Displays two suspicious Destination IPs on execution of the workbook

- **Signal Block:** This will raise a signal on detecting the suspicious IPs.

- **DQL block with \_trigger query:** Using **Generic Webhook plugin for Service Now**, an incident is created on Service Now based on the values given in the payload.
