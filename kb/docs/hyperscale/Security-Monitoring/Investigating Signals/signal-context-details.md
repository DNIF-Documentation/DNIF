**Introduced in v9.2.0**

  
Signal Context details help you understand all the multiple entities that are related to the suspect or target entity. This allows you to fetch all the incidents in the raw log where the particular entity is repeated. All the raw logs connected to this entity or the raw logs including this entity will be displayed in the raw logs section and the overview section will give an overview of the entity in all the raw logs.
