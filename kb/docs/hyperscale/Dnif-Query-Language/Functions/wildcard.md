DNIF DQL supports wildcard operators in conjunction with the LIKE operator. It is used to substitute one or more characters in a string. Wildcard characters are used with the LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

The following illustrates the syntax of the wildcard function:

```
stream=cloudtrail where useragent like "%amazonaws%"
```

The above query will return all the fields that have **amazonaws** in the cloudtrail stream. The output is shown as below:
