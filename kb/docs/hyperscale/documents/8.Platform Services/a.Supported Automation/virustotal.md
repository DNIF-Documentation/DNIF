VirusTotal's API lets you upload and scan files, submit and scan URLs, access finished scan reports and make automatic comments on URLs and samples without the need of using the HTML website interface.

###### **Real-time updates**

Malware signatures are updated frequently by VirusTotal as they are distributed by antivirus companies, this ensures that our service uses the latest signature sets. As soon as a given contributor blacklists a URL it is immediately reflected in user-facing verdicts.

###### **Detailed results**

VirusTotal not only tells you whether a given antivirus solution detected a submitted file as malicious, but also displays each engine's detection label (e.g., I-Worm.Allaple.gen). The same is true for URL scanners, most of which will discriminate between malware sites, phishing sites, suspicious sites, etc. Some engines will provide additional information, stating explicitly whether a given URL belongs to a particular botnet, which brand is targeted by a given phishing site, and so on.

```
_lookup virustotal get_url_report $Url
```

In the pipelined query function, the \_lookup directive calls the get\_url\_report function of the VirusTotal plugin. $Url is passed as a parameter to the function. This report contains details about the IP address such as the latest URL hosted on it, domain resolved to it, country to which it belongs and so on. The output is as shown below:

![image 3-Dec-26-2023-10-25-29-9474-AM](./images-Virustotal/Virustotal-5.webp)
