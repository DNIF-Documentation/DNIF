DNIF receives logs from multiple log sources like hosts, devices, connectors, etc. Each of these log sources are tagged with a Device Source IP to denote the source of these logs with the field **$DevSrcIP**.

To get more information about the values in **DevSrcIP** field, an enrichment bucket can be created which refers to data from an eventstore for Assets to extract more information about the source device.

Let's consider an example, the event store **AssetStore** has data imported from a **csv** file. Displayed below is a sample **csv** file.  
  
[asset\_store.csv](https://m.dnif.it/hubfs/asset_store.csv)

###### **Upload a custom eventstore**

A custom event store called **AssetStore** can be created by uploading the .**csv** file containing source device data. The event store that you created will be listed as shown below:

An enrichment bucket for the field **$DevSrcIP** can be created to refer values from the **AssetStore** eventstore.

###### **Define a custom Enrichment Bucket**

The enrichment bucket would identify the additional details of a specific **$DevSrcIP** in the log events coming from different sources.

The yaml format is as follows:

```
bucket: IPv4fields:- DevSrcIPschema-version: 1.0source:- enr_key: '{$DevSrcIP}'  enr_values:    translate:      AssetGroup: AssetGroup      AssetName: AssetName      AssetOwner: AssetOwner  eventstore: AssetStore  sourcetype: event_store
```

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Bucket | Enter the name for the enrichment bucket. |
| Fields | Enter the field names to be enriched. |
| schema-version | Enter the schema version |
| Source | List of sources for the enrichment bucket.       **Note:** There can be multiple sources for one enrichment bucket   **Source Type:** Enter the source type i.e. dql/sql/eventstore   **Eventstore:** For this scenario, enter the eventstore name.   **Enr\_key:** Enter the desired value to be detected in output representation. For example, **‘{DevScrcIP}’Enr\_valuesTranslate:** Allows you to replace the column names of the query result. |

Save the enrichment bucket.

###### **Run a Search**

To check if enrichment has been added successfully, run a search on data to fetch enriched details. Enrichment will be applied to the field values mentioned in the enrichment bucket of yml file.

In the above screen, you can view the asset name, owner and group that correlates to the **$DevSrcIP** field.

From the query result, you can further drill down to each entity in the result by clicking on the **Information** icon and verify the enriched details.
