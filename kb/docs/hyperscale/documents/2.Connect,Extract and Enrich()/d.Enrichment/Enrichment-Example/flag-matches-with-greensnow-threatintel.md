GreenSnow is a third party threat intel integration source available with DNIF in the form of an external dataset integration. It is possible to obtain a list of malicious IP addresses seen in many environments using GreenSnow.

###### **GreenSnow Dataset Integration**

An eventstore called **greensnow** is automatically scheduled and is displayed as shown below:

An enrichment bucket for the field $IP can be created to refer values from the **greensnow** eventstore.

###### **Create a custom Enrichment Bucket**

To be able to identify or flag any known malicious IP addresses in the log events, an enrichment bucket can be created which refers to data from an event store for GreenSnow ThreatIntel to flag these malicious IP addresses.

The yaml format is as follows:

```
bucket: IPv4fields:- SrcIP- DstIP- RemoteIP- Domain- Systemschema-version: 1.0source:- enr_key: '{IP}'  enr_values:    translate:      IntelReference: IntelReference      IntelURL: IntelURL      ThreatType: Type  eventstore: greensnow  sourcetype: event_store
```

The enrichment bucket would identify the malicious IP in the log events coming from different sources and point to a specific IP address in the **$System** field.

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Bucket | Enter the name for the enrichment bucket. |
| Fields | Enter the field names to be enriched. |
| schema-version | Enter the schema version |
| Source | List of sources for the enrichment bucket. **Note:** There can be multiple sources for one enrichment bucket   **Source Type:** Enter the source type i.e. dql/sql/eventstore   **Eventstore:** For this scenario, enter the eventstore name (greensnow).   **Enr\_key:** Enter the desired values to be viewed in the output representation. **For example**, **‘{IP}’**   **Enr\_values**   **Translate:** Allows you to replace the column names of the query result. To replace enter : **For example**, **ThreatType: Type** In this case, the column name ThreatType is replaced with Type. |

Save the enrichment bucket.

###### **Run a Search**

To check if enrichment has been added successfully, run a search on data to fetch enriched details. Enrichment will be applied to the field values mentioned in the enrichment bucket of yml file.

In the above screen, **$Stream, $SrcPort, $DstIP, $SrcPort, $DstPort, $AssetGroup, $AssetName** fileds display the details correlated to the IP Address in **$SrcIP** field.

From the query result, you can click the **Information** icon to further drill down to each entity in the result and verify the enriched details.
