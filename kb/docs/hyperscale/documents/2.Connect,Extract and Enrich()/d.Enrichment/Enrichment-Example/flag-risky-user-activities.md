Various users can be identified in logs for different streams ingested by DNIF. Multiple signals can be raised for a Suspected User, this leads to Suspected User being a Risky User.

It is possible to enrich more data about a risky user by creating an enrichment bucket to find out the top Risky Users and add a tag against the user as being Risky.

###### **Define a custom Enrichment Bucket**

You can create a custom enrichment bucket to identify the top risky users and gather additional information on why a particular user is risky.

```
bucket: Userfields:- Userschema-version: 1.0source:- enr_key: '{$SuspectUser}'  enr_values:    annotate:      UserTag: Risky    translate:      $StatUniqueSum: RiskScore  query: "_fetch * from event where $Stream=SIGNALS AND $Duration=7d group stat_unique $SuspectUser sum $DetectionScore limit 10"  sourcetype: dql
```

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Bucket | Enter the name for the enrichment bucket. |
| Fields | Enter the field names to be enriched. |
| schema-version | Enter the schema version |
| Source | List of sources for the enrichment bucket. **Note:** There can be multiple sources for one enrichment bucket   **Source Type:** Enter the source type i.e. dql/sql/eventstore.   **Eventstore:** For this scenario, enter **dql** query.   **Enr\_key:** Enter the desired values to be detected in the output representation. **For example**, _'{$SuspectUser}'_   **Enr\_values**   **Translate:** Allows you to replace the column names of the query result. To replace enter : **For example**, **$StatUniqueSum: RiskScore** In this case, the column name **$StatUniqueSum** is replaced with **$RiskScore**. |

###### **Run a Search**

To check if enrichment has been added successfully, run a search on data to fetch enriched details. Enrichment will be applied to the field values mentioned in the enrichment bucket of yml file.

In the above screen, you can view all the additional information to identify a particular user to be risky.

From the query result, you can click the **Information** icon to further drill down to each entity in the result and verify the enriched details.
