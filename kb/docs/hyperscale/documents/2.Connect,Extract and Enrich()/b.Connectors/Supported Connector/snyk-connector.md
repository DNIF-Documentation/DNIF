Snyk connector uses the pull method to fetch audit logs using the Snyk REST API. DNIF can collect, normalize, and monitor Snyk audit logs to help you identify abnormal activity within your Snyk account in real time.

**Note:-** Note that a latency of up to 24 hours is possible due to Snyk Audit and Group log pagination. To avoid duplicate or lost data, DNIF pulls Snyk logs once a day.

###### **Prerequisites**  

- API Token

- Organization ID

- Group ID

**Note:-** A user with the Snyk Group Administrator and Organization Administration role is necessary.
