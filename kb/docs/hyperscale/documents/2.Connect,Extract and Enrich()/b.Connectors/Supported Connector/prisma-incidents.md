###### **Overview**

Prisma Cloud is the industry's most comprehensive cloud native security platform (CNSP), with the industry's broadest security and compliance coverage for users, applications, data, and the entire cloud native technology stack throughout the development lifecycle and across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

The Prisma Incidents connector fetches the Incidents generated by Prisma Cloud. Prisma Cloud Compute analyzes individual audits and correlates them together to surface unfolding attacks. These chains of related audits are called incidents.
