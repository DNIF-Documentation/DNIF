F5® Distributed Cloud Services are SaaS-based solutions offering security, networking, and application management services that can be deployed across multi-cloud, on-premises, and edge locations. To forward F5 logs to DNIF via TLS, we'll use the Global Log Receiver service provided by F5 Distributed Cloud Services.

###### **Prerequisites**

- A valid F5 Account with the ability to configure the Global Log Receiver.

- A TLS connector enabled on the DNIF side. Click here for [configuration details](https://www.dnif.it/en/kb/tls).

- Add the following IP ranges to your firewall's allow list:
    - 193.16.236.68/32
    
    - 185.160.8.156/32

###### **Capture the TLS Connector Certificate Details**  
  

**Step A: Configure TLS Connector on DNIF**

1. On the PICO/AD side, from the Console, configure the TLS connector and set **Client Authentication Enable** to **False**.

**Step B: Retrieve the Certificate Data**

Execute the following command in the PICO/AD backend to capture the connector certificate details. The default path is -> `/DNIF/<AD\_or\_PICO>/connectors/tls\_connector/DNIF\_TLS.crt`.

```
cat <path_of_connector_file>
```

```

**Step 3: Set Authentication**

1. Under **Authentication**, select **None** from the dropdown.

**Step 4: Enable TLS**

1. Toggle the **Show Advanced Fields** option.

3. In the TLS section, select **Use TLS** from the dropdown.

**Step 5: Disable Certificate and Hostname Verification**
