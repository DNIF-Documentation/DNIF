This works similarly to the limit keyword. This is because the last keyword also picks the newest/latest events first and then limits the number of events to be included in the final result set.

Take a look at the example given below:

```
stream=firewall | groupby dstport, dstcn |last 2
```

This query retrieves two fields: destination port and destination country. However, we limit the result set (last 2) to only 2 newest events which satisfy the where condition. The result set is sorted in the ascending order.
