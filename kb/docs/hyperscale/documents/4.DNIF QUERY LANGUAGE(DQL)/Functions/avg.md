The AVG function is an aggregate function that calculates the average value of a set. The following illustrates the syntax of the AVG function:

```
Stream=firewall | groupby dstcn | select dstcn, avg (evtlen)
```

Here,

- Stream is Firewall

- Groupby function allows to organize similar data into groups i.e. groupby destination country.

- Select function helps you to retrieve records from one or more tables, the records retrieved are known as a result set.

- The avg ( ) function returns the average value of a numeric column.

In this case, on execution it should retrieve all fields for each event where the stream is a firewall; it retrieves the average value in each group. The output is shown as below:
