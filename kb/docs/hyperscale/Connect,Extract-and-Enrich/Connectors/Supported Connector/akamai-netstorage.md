Akamai connector is intended to read and ingest content from your NetStorage Account.

###### **Prerequisites**

- Netstorage Domain Name

- Netstorage Key Name

- Netstorage Key

- Netstorage CP Code

###### **How to derive the prerequisites?**

- In Akamai, in the left menu navigate to ORIGIN SERVICES > NetStorage.

- In the left menu, click Upload Accounts.

- Create an upload account if required, and enable the HTTP API authentication in access methods, this will give you the **NetStorage Key**.

- The **NetStorage** **Hostname** is xxx-nsu.akamaihd.net

- The **NetStorage** **Key name** is the id of the upload account.

- Each NetStorage storage group can have multiple upload directories, adding an upload directory will also add a CP Code (the upload directory name will be the **NetStorage** **CP Code**. )
