Jira connector uses the pull method to fetch audit logs using the Jira Cloud platform REST API. All Jira products are on free plans. Audit logs are available when at least one Jira product is on a paid plan. DNIF can collect, normalize, and monitor Jira logs to help you identify abnormal activity within your Jira account in real time.
