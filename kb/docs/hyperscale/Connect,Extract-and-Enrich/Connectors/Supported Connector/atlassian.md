Atlassian provides team collaboration software that helps teams organize, discuss, and complete shared work. DNIF can collect, normalize, and monitor Atlassian organization audit logs, helping you identify any suspicious activity within your organization in real-time.

###### **Pre-requisites**

- Atlassian organization ID

- Atlassian API Key

###### **Steps to derive prerequisites**

- Go to [admin.atlassian.com](http://admin.atlassian.com/). Select your organization if you have more than one.

- Select **Settings > API keys**.

- Select **Create API key** in the top right.

- Enter a name that you'll remember to identify the API key.

- By default, the key expires one week from today. If you'd like to change the expiration date, pick a new date under **Expires on**. You're unable to select a date longer than a year from the date of creation.

- Select **Create** to save the API key.

- Copy the values for your **Organization ID** and **API key**. You'll need those to use the API key.  
    **Note**: Make sure you store these values in a safe place, as we won't show them to you again.

- Select **Done**. The key will appear in your list of API keys.  
    **Note**: If you have trouble creating the API key, refer to the detailed guide - [Organization Audit logs](https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/manage-an-organization-with-the-admin-apis/).
