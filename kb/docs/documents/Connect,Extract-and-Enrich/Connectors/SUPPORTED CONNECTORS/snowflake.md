- Click **Save** after entering all the required details and click **Test Connection**, to test the configuration.

- A **Connection successful** message will be displayed on screen along with the time stamp.

- If the connection is not successful an error message will be displayed. Refer [Troubleshooting Connector Validations](https://dnif.it/kb/troubleshooting-and-debugging/troubleshooting-connector-validations/) for more details on the error message.

Once the connector is configured, validate if the connector is listed under **[Collection Status](https://dnif.it/kb/operations/collection-status/)** screen with status as **Active**. This signifies the connector is configured successfully and data is ready to ingest.
