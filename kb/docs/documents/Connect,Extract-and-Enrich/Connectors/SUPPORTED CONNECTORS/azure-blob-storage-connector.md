Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's cloud-based object storage solution for storing large amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, videos, backups, and log files. Within Azure Blob Storage, a container acts as a logical grouping of blobs (binary large objects). DNIF supports the configuration of an Azure Blob Storage Connector to pull log data directly from your Azure Storage container, allowing you to write detections and perform investigations on the processed data.

## **Pre-requisites**

- Tenant ID

- Client ID

- Client Secret

- Storage Account Name

- Queue Name

## **Steps to derive prerequisites:-**

To create an Azure Blob Storage log source, you must first ensure that within your Azure subscription settings, **Microsoft.EventGrid** and **Microsoft.Storage** are registered resource providers. Verify this by following these steps:

1. In your Azure Console, navigate to **Subscriptions**.

3. Select the subscription you will be creating your Azure resources in.

5. Within the subscription settings, click **Resource providers**.

7. In the Filter by name field, search for and locate **Microsoft.EventGrid** and **Microsoft.Storage**. 

9. For each of these providers, ensure the Status column has a value of **Registered**.

## **Create the required infrastructure in the Azure Console:**

On the **Infrastructure & Configuration** page, you'll create required Azure infrastructure and provide configuration values required for configuration.

<!-- ![](./image-Azure%20Blob%20Storage%20Connector/Azure-Blob-Storage-Connector-12.png) -->

| **Field Name**  | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Connector Name | Enter a name for the connector |
| Tenant ID | Enter Azure Tenant ID |
| Client ID | Enter the Azure Client ID |
| Client Secret | Enter the Azure Client Secret |
| Storage Account Name | Enter the Azure Storage Account Name |
| Queue Name | Enter the Azure Queue Name |
| Prefix (Optional) | Enter the Prefix path from which you want to pull data from the container |
| Delete Unmatched Prefix | Choose True or False to delete Unmatched Prefix messages from the Azure queue |

- Click **Save** after entering all the required details and click **Test Connection**, to test the configuration.

- A **Connection successful** message will be displayed on screen along with the time stamp.

- If the connection is not successful an error message will be displayed. Refer [Troubleshooting Connector Validations](https://dnif.it/kb/troubleshooting-and-debugging/troubleshooting-connector-validations/) for more details on the error message.

Once the connector is configured, validate if the connector is listed under **[Collection Status](https://dnif.it/kb/operations/collection-status/)** screen with status as **Active**. This signifies the connector is configured successfully and data is ready to ingest.
