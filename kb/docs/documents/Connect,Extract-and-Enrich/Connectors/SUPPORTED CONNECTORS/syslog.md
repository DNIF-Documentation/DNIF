Syslog Connector can receive logs from various devices and log sources via UDP connection on port 514 of the Adapter

## **Pre-requisites**

- Ensure that port 514UDP is open and is not occupied by some other services to enable forwarding of log events.

- Log in to the server as the root user.

- Install syslog package, if you haven’t installed it using the below command:

```
apt-get install rsyslog
```

- Edit rsyslog configuration with vim /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf and paste following line below

```
*.* @DNIF-Adapter-IP:514
```

- Save the syslog configuration file.

- Restart the rsyslog service using the below command

```
/etc/init.d/rsyslog restart
```
