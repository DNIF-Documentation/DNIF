HubSpot is a widely used CRM platform that includes marketing, sales, service, operations, and website-building software to help grow your business. The DNIF HubSpot connector utilizes the [CMS Content Audit API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/cms/content-audit?__hstc=3119151.0ad961abce813fdd9af1902c8762ee15.1736423936778.1737376690829.1737438937632.14&__hssc=3119151.44.1737438937632&__hsfp=3310115484) to collect, normalize, and monitor HubSpot audit logs of CMS changes in your HubSpot account. This helps you identify abnormal activity in real-time. Note that this endpoint is only available for accounts with a CMS Hub Enterprise subscription.
