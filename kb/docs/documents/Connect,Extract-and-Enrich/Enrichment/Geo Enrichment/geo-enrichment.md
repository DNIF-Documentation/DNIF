A Geo enrichment is used to contextually enrich IP addresses captured in log data with geographic location intelligence. It includes all the information regarding a particular IP address such as the country code, location, latitude and longitude, ISP details. The ability to identify the criticality with this enriched information is the key to have a clear understanding to threat hunters and analysts to initiate faster decisions and actions.
