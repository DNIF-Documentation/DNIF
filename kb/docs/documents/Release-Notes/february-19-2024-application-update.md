- Users now have the capability to effortlessly craft reusable content within their workbooks, streamlining the development process and enhancing productivity.

- Workbook chaining - Workbooks can now be called from others using the new Call and Return blocks.

- This reduces workbook development time and facilitates ease of change of content. Also, reusable workbooks are more reliable as the content is already tested.

- Use the Call block for scenarios where data is not modified e.g. for calling Notification workbooks. [Know more](https://dnif.it/kb/hunting-with-workbooks/getting-started-hunting-with-workbooks/create-a-call-block/).

- Use the Return block for seamless incorporation of changes back into the calling workbook e.g. for calling Enrichment workbooks. [Know more](https://dnif.it/kb/hunting-with-workbooks/getting-started-hunting-with-workbooks/create-a-return-block/)
