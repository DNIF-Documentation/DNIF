- ### **Extractor Validator**
    - **Validates Extractor syntax**  
        Enhances workflow with syntax validations, reducing debugging time.
    
    - **Highlights duplicate streams and fields**  
        Alerts the security engineer to avoid using duplicate streams and fields.
    
    - **Identifies new streams and fields**   
        Prompts the security engineer to consider using existing streams and fields from the DNIF Data Model. The user can alternatively request the addition of new streams and fields.
    
    - **Verifies primary log sources and log events**  
        Verify whether the given extractor parses the provided log samples.
    
    - **Uniqueness of Log Samples & Extractors  
        **Verifies the uniqueness of provided log samples against existing extractors.  
        Also ensures that the given extractor uniquely parses only the provided log samples.
