Signal tagging is a new feature that helps users assign tags to signals, Tags can be used for different types of classifications such as the type of threat or threat campaign, APT group etc. This makes it easier to organize alerts and locate specific ones quickly. Signal tagging also enhances collaboration among team members by providing a common language and framework for discussing alerts. This leads to better communication and teamwork when analyzing and responding to threats. You could also use signal tagging to classify signals and then use tags for secondary detection to connect threats and uncover campaigns.

### **INFORMATICS - SEE THE BIG PICTURE IN ONE PLACE**

The updated landing page after user login offers a centralized view of crucial data pertaining to your platform, making it convenient to monitor essential metrics like license usage, EPS, search utilization, online storage, streamed workbooks, MITRE ATT&CK tactic and technique coverage, collection status, and stream status. You can also access this page by clicking on the DNIF logo at the top left corner of the console.
