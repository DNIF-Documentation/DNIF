The feature to effortlessly navigate DNIF Console logs is crucial for a few reasons:

1. First, by filtering logs with 'Stream=HYPERCLOUD,' users can directly analyze logs related to the HYPERCLOUD console, gaining insights into entity related events ensuring the platform's smooth operation.

3. Second, filtering on 'Streams’ IAM and AUTHENTICATION' with 'SourceName=HYPERCLOUD' allows users to focus on logs concerning user authentication and authorization. This is vital for monitoring user activities and ensuring compliance with security policies.
