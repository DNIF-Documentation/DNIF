### **MTTA - Mean Time to Acknowledge**

MTTA measures the average time taken by a security team to acknowledge a security alert after it has been generated.MTTA helps in the following:

1. **Responsiveness Tracking**: MTTA helps monitor how quickly the security team responds to alerts, indicating the effectiveness of alert handling and initial response. A shorter MTTA suggests that potential threats are being acted upon quickly, reducing the window of exposure.

3. **Incident Prioritization**: By tracking MTTA, teams can identify whether alerts are being acknowledged in a timely manner and whether the most critical incidents are getting the attention they need first.

5. **Early Intervention**: A fast acknowledgment time means that the security team is quickly aware of potential threats, allowing for early-stage containment before incidents escalate into major security breaches.

7. **Process Optimization**: High MTTA values can reveal inefficiencies in alerting workflows or indicate alert fatigue. This helps teams identify areas for process improvement, such as better alert prioritization or automation.

9. **Resource Management**: MTTA offers insight into whether the security team is properly staffed or equipped to handle the volume of alerts. Longer acknowledgment times might indicate the need for more resources or automation tools to assist with triage.

### **MTTR - Mean Time to Resolve**

MTTR measures the average time taken to fully resolve security incidents once they’ve been detected. MTTR helps in the following:

1. **Incident Response Efficiency**: MTTR provides insights into how quickly your security team can address and mitigate threats. A lower MTTR means quicker resolution of incidents, reducing potential damage.

3. **Evaluating Security Effectiveness**: By tracking MTTR, organizations can evaluate the efficiency of their incident response processes, tools, and workflows, helping identify areas for improvement.

5. **Minimizing Downtime**: Faster resolution times ensure that disruptions to business operations or IT services caused by security incidents are kept to a minimum.

7. **Resource Planning**: Monitoring MTTR helps in allocating the right resources, such as staffing or automation tools, to speed up the resolution process.

**Note:** TTA and TTR values will be calculated on cases that have been created on or after the feature release date.
