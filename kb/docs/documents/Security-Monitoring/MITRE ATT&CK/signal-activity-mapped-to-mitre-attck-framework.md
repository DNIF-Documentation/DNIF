## **Components of Signal Tab**

| **Fields** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Signal Count![](./signal-activity-mapped-to-mitre-attck-img/signal-activity-mapped-to-mitre-attck-framework-2.png)  | Total number of signals generated from workbooks associated with a particular technique (in the last 7 days by default). |
| Legend ![](./signal-activity-mapped-to-mitre-attck-img/signal-activity-mapped-to-mitre-attck-framework-3.png) | The color coding represents the ratio of the total signal count for each technique to the sum of all signal counts, displayed as a percentage across the selected duration.    |

## **Filtering over Signal Activity:**

- **1 Day:** Shows signal activity for the current day.

- **7 Day:**  Shows Signal Activity over the last 7 days. (default time filter)

###### **Visualizing the Signal Activity by Timeline**

Displays a line chart of signal activity over the selected duration (default: 7 days). Users can view signal counts for specific days or times. By clicking on a workbook name in the list, its data line is highlighted, allowing users to investigate signal activity for the selected workbook. (**Note:** To deselect a workbook, double-click its name.)
