DNIF library has extractors ready to ingest data from all types of devices. It auto detects devices sending logs to DNIF and the extractors associated with them, this information is listed on the device management screen. It lists the devices that are sending logs to the console along with the IP addresses, extractors and streams associated for informational purposes. In addition, A provision has been made to manually add devices when it is required for the rare case where one needs to make a specific parser mapping for a particular device.

- Extractors are used to extract information from the incoming logs.
