A Workbook with a collection of queries can be saved and scheduled to run at set intervals. Users don’t have to manually write a query every time, the scheduler will run the query at the designated time and signal the users in case of any threat detection. It provides control and visibility into the enterprise.

## **Streamed Workbooks**

The objective of Streamed Workbooks is to enable continuous threat detection without having to manually figure out schedules for executing content.

- If the main query in the streamed workbook searches a duration of up to 30 minutes or has no duration specified, it will be triggered every minute as long as logs are received in the corresponding stream.

- If the main query in the streamed workbook searches a duration longer than 30 minutes, it will be auto-scheduled to execute thrice in the specified duration and not every minute. For example, if the duration in the query is 90 minutes, the workbook will trigger every 30 minutes searching a duration of 90 minutes. Such queries will be executed on the report server and not correlation server.

- In the interest of platform stability and availability, we strongly discourage specifying a duration in streamed workbooks. It will default to scanning the last five minute duration and trigger every minute data is ingested in the stream.
