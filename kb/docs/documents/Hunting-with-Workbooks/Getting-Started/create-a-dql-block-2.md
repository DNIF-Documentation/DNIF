DNIF uses its own Query Language known as DQL, a primary form of interaction with the Datanode to analyse and interpret the data. You can add multiple DQL blocks in a Workbook to retrieve data quickly and efficiently. This section introduces you to the various elements and query directives you can use to work with this interface.

## **How to add DQL Blocks?**

- Hover on the **Workbooks** icon on the left navigation bar, it will display the folder wise view of existing workbooks in the tenant (previously known as cluster).
