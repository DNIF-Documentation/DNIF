In the **Workbook** section, the **Return Block** is essential for managing the flow of control and data between different workbooks. It works similar to the **Call Block** and provides a mechanism to return control and values to the calling workbook.

## **Overview** 

- It **passes the output of the previous block** that was executed in the calling workbook to the called workbook on the **Return Block**.

- Once the called workbook finishes its execution, the **Return Block** ensures that control and specified output are passed back to the calling workbook.

## **How to add a Return Block?**

### **Steps to Configure Return Block:**

Navigate to the Blocks Section:

- Hover on the **Workbooks** icon on the left navigation bar, it will display the folder-wise view of existing workbooks in the tenant (previously known as cluster).

- Run the Return Block. 

- The resultset from the previous block is passed to the Workbook called in the Return Block. The Workbook mentioned in the Return block is executed.

- Once the Return Block is executed, control and data are returned from the called Workbook to the calling workbook. As a result, the result set from the called Workbook is displayed in the Return Block.  
    

- In the **Workbook** page, click on **Plus icon**. This will take you to a list of available blocks then select the **Return Block** from the list.
