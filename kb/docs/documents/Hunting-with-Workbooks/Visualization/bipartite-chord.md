This chart displays the flows or connections between different entities, each entity represents a part of the circular layout.  You can hover a specific entity to highlight all its connections. You will have to group your data to form the chord.

## **Creating a bipartite chord diagram** 

- Go to workbooks, add a DQL block and enter a query. Ensure the  query includes a stream  and the results are grouped as per requirement.  
      
    **For Example**

```
stream=firewall| groupby srccn, dstcn
```

- This query retrieves all fields for each event where stream=firewall and the output is grouped by srccn and dstcn . The final output is sorted in the descending order of count\_unique (by default). The query results will be displayed as follows.
