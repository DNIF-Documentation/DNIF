A bubble chart is a chart in which the data points are displayed as bubbles, and an additional dimension of the data is represented in the size of the bubbles. You will require three values to create a default bubble chart and four values to create a stacked bubble chart.

## **Creating a Bubble Chart**

- Go to workbooks, add a DQL block and enter a query. Ensure the output of stream is grouped as per requirement.  
      
    For Example:

```
   stream=firewall | groupby app, dstcn, rxlen
```

- The stream=firewall directive retrieves all fields for each event where **Stream** is **FIREWALL**. The result set is grouped by unique values of **app , dstcn, and rxlen** along with a count for each group. The result set is sorted in the descending order of **count** (by default).  The output is displayed as follows.
