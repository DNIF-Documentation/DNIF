## **About This Handbook**  

  
The DNIF Support Team provides technical support to its Enterprise and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) users. The DNIF Support Handbook is the central repository for why and how we work the way we do.

This handbook lets you know about services we can provide to you, because we care about your success, we want to help you receive the service you need. We will also direct you to other valuable sources of information that you will find extremely beneficial.

Information in this handbook is subject to change at any time to improve upon the level of service that we provide to you.

Additionally, this handbook sets a clear, explicit set of standards for DNIF Customer Support. Our employees and customers share visibility into this public commitment. We hold ourselves to these standards; let us know if you feel we are falling short.

## **Completed DNIF Enterprise Deployment Or need to be onboarded on SaaS**

  
In case you have just completed an Enterprise deployment of DNIF or have been onboarded on DNIF SaaS, you would receive an onboarding kit along with project signoff over email and subsequently we would initiate the following activities:

- Handover the project to our Operations team.

- Create and invite users on our Support Portal

- Share Customer Support Handbook.

You can keep track of all of your tickets and their current status using the DNIF support portal. We recommend using the support portal for a superior experience managing your tickets.

## **Support Portal Unaccessible**

  
Occasionally, you may find the support portal not acting as expected. This is often caused by the user's setup, on encountering this, the recommended course of action is:

1. Ensure your browser is allowing third party cookies, these are often vital for the system to work.

3. Disable all plugins/extensions/add ons on the browser.

5. Disable any themes on the browser.

7. Clear all cookies and cache on the browser.

9. If you or your organization use restrictive firewall or proxy server settings, then refer: [IP addresses and domains for Atlassian cloud products](https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/ip-addresses-and-domains-for-atlassian-cloud-products/).

11. Try logging in again to the the Support Portal.

13. If you are still having issues, write down the browser version, type, distro/Operating System, and other identifying information and share with DNIF Delivery Team during implementation.

## **Update on extractor support**

  
With the release of DNIF v9.1.1, we have introduced Schema on Read as a new feature in DNIF. This allows users to extract additional fields which have not been included in the extractor by extracting these while creating the DQL query.

With this update, DNIF Support will not be making any modifications to the extractor provided and customers are encouraged to leverage the above capability for the same. Details of the new new version release and the new feature can be found below

## **Support Escalations**  
  

1. Check if the concern or request raised on the ticket is not excluded from support scope.

3. For open tickets, share every possible detail such as logs, screenshots etc. while communicating about your questions or issues. For example, if a support engineer has to ask for logs, it will result in more cycles.

5. In subsequent replies, the support engineer may ask you follow-up questions or share SOPs. Please do your best to read through the entirety of the reply to avoid any confusion.

7. It is expected that you review and execute the checks as mentioned in SOPs and share screenshots of the outcome with Support Engineer to analyze the problem and will have what is necessary to further escalate to developers or request for a screen share virtual session if so required.

9. n case you observe there is something amiss in the efforts or overall expectations, kindly reach out to below contacts by sending an email with your concerns:  
    

| **Escalation Level** | **Designation** | **Type of Escalation** | **Contact Details** | **Procedure** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary | Jira Portal | Email | https://dnif.atlassian.net/ | All initial concerns, queries, and issues should be logged through the Jira portal provided. |
| First | Support Lead | Email/Call | supportlead@net-mon.net | If the issue is not resolved within a reasonable time or requires immediate attention, contact the Support Lead via email or phone call. |

Note: Ensure that each level of escalation is triggered only if the previous level fails to resolve the issue satisfactorily within a reasonable timeframe. Clearly document all communication, include the artefacts and actions taken at each level of escalation for reference and accountability.

Note: The SLAs and deliverables mentioned here do not apply to non-standard environments or air-gapped deployments where access cannot be guaranteed.

## **Documentation for Self Resolution**

  
Extensive documentation ranging from basic feature walk through to solutioning and troubleshooting your DNIF setup is available on the [DNIF Documentation Portal](https://support.dnif.it/en/kb), users can leverage the search box on the portal to quickly find related articles of interest and follow the same.

## **Customer Satisfaction**

  
Within 24 hours after a ticket is resolved or automatically closed due to a lack of activity, a Customer Satisfaction survey will be sent out on the ticket reporter's registered email address on the portal. We track responses to these surveys to improve ourselves and provide better user experience and service.

Support Management regularly reviews responses, and may contact customers who leave negative reviews for more context.

## **General Support Practices**  

  
### **Do Not Use Language Intended to Threaten or Harass**

Please treat ticket communications with the same respect you would while talking in person. We need to keep this a clean and well-lighted place for civilized discourse. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.

One way to improve a discussion is by discovering existing or past tickets that are already happening or related. Spend time browsing and reading the ticket and trailing replies before replying. This would help add more context to the conversation and give ideas on how the ticket can be amicably resolved.

Repeat violations may result in termination of your support contract and/or business relationship with DNIF.

### **Do Not Send Encrypted Messages**  
  
Some organizations use 3rd party services to encrypt or automatically expire messages. As a matter of security, please do not include any sensitive information in the body or attachments in tickets. All interactions with DNIF Support should be in plain-text.  
DNIF Support Engineers will not click on URLs contained within tickets or interact with these type of 3rd party services to provide support. If you do send such a reply, an engineer will politely ask you to submit your support ticket in plain text, and link you to this section of our Support Handbook.If there's a pressing reason for which you need to send along an encrypted file or communication, please discuss it with the Engineer in the ticket.

### **Do Not Share Login Credentials**  
  
Do not share login credentials for your DNIF instance to the support team. If the team needs more information about the problem, we will offer to schedule a call with you.

### **Sanitize data attached to Support Tickets**  
  
If relevant to the problem and helpful in troubleshooting, a DNIF Support Engineer will request information regarding configuration files or logs. We encourage customers to sanitize all secrets and private information before sharing them in a DNIF Support ticket.

### **Support for DNIF on restricted or offline networks**  
  
DNIF Support may request logs in Support tickets or ask you to screen share in customer calls if it would be the most efficient and effective way to troubleshoot and solve the problem. Under certain circumstances, sharing logs or screen sharing may be difficult or impossible due to our customers' internal network security policies. DNIF Support will never ask our customers to violate their internal security policies, but Support Engineers do not know the details of our customers' internal network security policies. In situations where internal or network security policies would prevent you from sharing logs or screen sharing with DNIF Support, please communicate this as early as possible in the ticket so we can adjust the workflows and methods we use to troubleshoot. Customer policies preventing the sharing of log or configuration information with Support may lengthen the time to resolution for tickets. Customer policies preventing screen sharing during DNIF Support customer calls may impact a Support Engineer's ability to resolve issues during a scheduled call.

### **Handling Unresponsive Tickets**  
  
To prevent an accumulation of tickets for which we have not received a response within a specific timescale, we have established the following process. If the ticket reporter (end user) fails to respond within 3 days following our last reply, our ticketing system will mark the ticket as archived. If the ticket reporter fails to respond within 15 days of the ticket being marked as archived, our ticketing system will proceed to close the ticket.
