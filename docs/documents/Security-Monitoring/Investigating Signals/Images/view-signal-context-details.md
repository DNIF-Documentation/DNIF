The Selected Signal screen displays the signal context details of the entity as follows.

| **Field Name**  | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Overview | This section gives a brief overview of all the raw log events fetched in the Raw Events section for a particular entity. Let's consider ten raw log events are fetched for a particular entity in the **Raw Events**, then in the Overview section, the numbers displayed next to the entities indicate that there are multiple entities involved and the number denotes the number of times each entity is repeated throughout the logs. Also, if there is only one entity that is repeated throughout all the logs, then there won't be a number indicator next to the entity. |
