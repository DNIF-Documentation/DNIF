User Management is the process of creating and maintaining a user store. User management establishes a user's authorization to access secure resources, it also serves as a repository of identities and is the source of all identities in an organization. Access control is applied to regulate who can view or use resources in a particular environment.

## **Cluster Administrator**

- The user created at the First time UI stage will be the Cluster Administrator.
- A Cluster Administrator is the Super Administrator and will manage all the scopes that fall under the Cluster.
- The user roles are assigned and managed by Cluster Administrators across all the scopes.

## **Example:**

- Times Group has multiple subsidiaries that are managed by them such as Times Music, Times Internet, Times Business Solutions etc.
- In this case, a DNIF Deployment Scenario could be Time Group as a cluster and the various subsidiaries as various scopes within the Times Group cluster.
