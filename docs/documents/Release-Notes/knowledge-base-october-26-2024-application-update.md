We are happy to introduce new features to improve your experience with our platform. Here's what's included in this release:

## **What’s New**

- ### **MTTD - Mean Time to Detect**  
      
    MTTD measures the average time taken to detect a security incident. This means the time taken to raise a signal after the raw log event for the same has been ingested. MTTD helps in the following:

1. **Early Threat Identification**: MTTD allows security teams to assess how quickly they can identify potential security incidents. A lower MTTD means quicker detection, reducing the time attackers have to cause damage.

3. **Reducing Incident Impact**: Faster incident detection leads to quicker responses, which can limit the scope of damage, data loss, or disruption. A low MTTD minimizes the window for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.

5. **Improving Security Posture**: MTTD is a key metric in continuous improvement processes. Tracking it over time helps organizations refine detection mechanisms, rules, and policies in their SIEM system to reduce detection times further.

7. **Compliance and Reporting**: Many industries have regulations requiring that incidents be detected and reported within a certain timeframe. MTTD ensures that organizations comply with these requirements by providing a measurable way to track detection speed.

**Note:** The Time to Detect (TTD) will be calculated daily at midnight for each region. TTD values will be calculated for signals generated on or after the feature release date.
