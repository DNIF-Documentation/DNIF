We are excited to announce a new update driven by valuable customer feedback. This release focuses on offering a more efficient user management experience. Organizations have direct administrative controls to manage users and assign them roles based on their work profiles. 

## **WHAT'S NEW**

### **Efficient user lifecycle management and tenant administration** 

- Empowering Organizations: Enjoy direct administrative rights to manage the User lifecycle and have more granular control of your tenant.

- Decoupling User lifecycle management from Role-Based Access Control. The Organization Administrator handles user lifecycle management, and the tenant administrator manages access to Tenant capability.

For more information refer to the [User Management & Access Control](https://dnif.it/kb/user-management-access-control/dnif-entities/) documentation on KB.

## **ENHANCEMENTS**

- Added support for using new DQL fields as parameters in the Notification block.
