The Search query retrieves the $User field for each event in the UserDetails (custom) eventstore.

### **Output**

```
_lookup user_store get_user_info $User
```

In the pipelined query function, the \_lookup directive calls the get\_user\_info function of the user\_store plugin. $User is passed as a parameter to the function. This report contains details about the User such as the Employee ID, Department, Location of the User and so on. The output is as shown below:

The Lookup call returns output based on the available data in the event store.
