Enabling CEF logging on a NetScaler Application Firewall Appliance

The Citrix NetScaler appfw allows the user to enable the CEF Logging from Graphical User Interface (GUI) as well as from the command line interface. The CEF Logging is disabled by default.

```
$ set appfw settings CEFLogging on
```

In GUI, you can enable this parameter from the engine settings dialogue.
